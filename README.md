# holidayChecker

Check whether a given date is a holiday - locale-aware

This library allows you to check a single day against one or multiple calendars
to see whether the given day is a holiday or not.

That also includes "named Days" that are not necessarily "free" but have a special
name like "Maundy Thursday".

## Installation

holidayChecker is best installed using [composer](https://getcomposer.org)

```bash
composer require org_heigl/holidaychecker
```

## Usage

Simple usage:

```php
$factory  = new HolidayIteratorFactory();
$iterator = $factory->createIteratorFromXmlFile('path/to/a/holiday/file.xml');
$checker  = new Holidaychecker($iterator);

$result = $checker->check(new \DateTime());
// $result will be an instance of Org_Heigl\HolidayChecker\Holiday
```

$result has 3 methods:

* **isHoliday** is ```true``` when the day is a free day according to the local law. Otherwise it's ```false```
* **isNamed** is ```true``` when the day has a special name despite being not a free day.
* **getName** contains the name of a named day.

You can also get a ```HolidayIterator``` with a 2-letter [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
or a 4-letter [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) code. And when different language-variations are available you can get them
by adding the [ISO 639-1 language-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) before the ISO 3166-code:

```php
// Get the holidays for mainland france
$iterator = $factory->createIteratorFromIso3166('FR');

// Get the holidays for the french overseas-department La Reunion
$iterator = $factory->createIteratorFromIso3166('FR-RE');

// Get the dutch holidays for belgium
$iterator = $factory->createIteratorFromIso3166('fr_BE');
```

## Extending

Currently not all countries holidays are available. We are trying to fix that
but you might find that exactly the country you need is missing.

As the holidays are retrieved from XML-files you can add your own ones without
issue. They need to correspond to the [Schema-file](https://github.com/heiglandreas/holidayChecker/blob/master/share/holidays.xsd)
and before the schema is checked any XInclude-statements are executed.

You can then load the holidays from your file using the ```createIteratorFromXmlFile```-method.

If you think the XML-files might be usefull for others you should think about
contributing back and open a PullRequest here or attach them to an issue you open.

We'd be very thankfull!

## Comparison

### Yasumi

The main other library in the PHP-ecosystem that also provides holiday-calendars
is the [Yasumi-library](https://packagist.org/packages/azuyalabs/yasumi). There are some
differences between those two libraries though that I want to highlight here.

The main difference is that Yasumi is a purely programatical library. The holidays and their rules are
written down in code. Extending the library by adding new calendars or modifying existing ones to own requirements
requires actual coding. Contrary to that in this library the actual data is provided in XML-files. SO adding new
calendars or extending existing ones requires one to create a new or modify an existing XML-file. Whether that is easier
that doing PHP-programming is up to the user to decide.

Besides that Yasumi uses pre-calculated dates for holidays that are based on a non-gregorian calendar like
for islamic, jewish or lunar-based holidays. This library on the other side defines holidays based on the
day in a certain calendar. For that we use the ICUs calendars under the hood which allows us to declare holidays based
on the buddhist, chinese, coptic, ethiopian, hebrew, indian, islamic, japanese and persian calendar.
For the islamic calendar we support different versions of day-calculation, mainly the astronomical and the civilian
calendar. Both libraries have their issues when a calendaring system is used, that is based on an actual person
observing something like the islamic calendar used in Saudi-Arabia. As these calendars are based on visual observation
they can not be precalculated and therefore not be used with a precalculating library.

Given this difference the Yasumi-Library currently only allows usage of dates between 1949 and 2050 whereas this library
is free in the daterange to be used.

Another difference are the requirements. While Yasumi only requires a PHP of up to PHP7.4 with the JSON extension
available this library requires the DOM-extension (XML) as well as the INTL-extension as we are using that to calculate
holidays based on different calendaring systems. This library also requires a library to compare dateintervals which is
used in the calculation of the easter-date.

### Calendarific

[Calendarific](https://calendarific.com) is an SaaS Provider that provides worldwide Bank-Holidays and Observances via
An API.

They are currently supporting all countries worldwide. Their API can be queried for holiday information on a per country
and year basis. It is possible to only fetch information to a sub-area of a country (like states in the US or Kantone
in Switzerland). YOu can also just check one specific day by providing the day and the month along with the year.

As the pricing of the API limits the number of API calls per month, calling the API on a per-day basis migth not be the
best of ideas. Also the API provides information for either local, national or religious holidays as well as observances
(where observances in one region can be national or regional holidays in another region). Sadly it seems not to be
possible to fetch only regional and national holidays in one request. It is either all of them or only a single one.
And as the "observation" type is rather chatty (it contains a lot of special dates that might or might not have any
relevance at all - like astronomical observations that might be calculated better using separate libraries)

So as consumer it requires a lot of work afterwards to get the actualy required data when wanting to get the information
whether a certain day is a holiday in the requested area or not.

It serves a purpose and is readily available. At a price.

## Missing Features

### Business-Days
Some people were asking about a feature to calculate working days. While that seems to be a neat function I decided against
implementing it in the library as business-days are very domain-specific. While there are some generally accepted
terms of "working days" being monday through saturday excludign the public holidays that is not always and
everywhere the correct way. SO depending on your business-domain workdays might only be monday through friday
and not all public holidays are actually excluded but only a subset. Like bank-holidays in the UK that are only
for banks a holiday, but for a lot of other businesses they mean business-as-usual. Or perhaps not, depending on
a lot of different factors.

To not lead people into false expectations and use amagic that will bite back rather sooner than later I decided to
not implement this in the library but leave that to your business-logic.

To give you an idea how such a feature could look like I wrote an example that show that most of the required code is
actually business-case related or required for setup. Only three lines are related to this library. So having
a dedicated class for that in this library doesn't seem to make sense.

use Org_Heigl\Holidaychecker\Holidaychecker;
use Org_Heigl\Holidaychecker\HolidayIteratorFactory;

$factory  = new HolidayIteratorFactory();
$iterator = $factory->createIteratorFromIso3166('DE');
$checker  = new Holidaychecker($iterator);

$startDate = new DateTimeImmutable('2022-10-10');
$endDate   = new DateTimeImmutable('2022-10-31');
$dateIterator = new DatePeriod(
    $startDate,
    new DateInterval('P1D'),
    $endDate
);

$numberOfBusinessDays = 0;

foreach ($dateIterator as $date) {
    if ($checker->check($date)->isHoliday()) {
        continue;
    }

    // Your business-Logic here
    // This is where the magic actually happens.
    // Whether you count only sundays.
    // Or saturdays AND sundays or whatever else your general days off are!
    $numberOfBusinessDays++;
}

echo sprintf(
    'There are %1$d business-days between %2$s and %3$s',
    $numberOfBusinessDays,
    $startDate->format('d.m.Y'),
    $endDate->format('d.m.Y'),
);
```
